Notes:
First brewday with the Dominator 40!

Preparation is much simpler, no engineering tasks with pipes and what not. Prepare the steps and fill it up with water.

Volume after mashing: 12 l

Can quite precisely measure the volume of the mash so added the lid when it reached 10 l after 15 mins boiling. Will have to up the Mashing volume next time

@10 - Volume level dropping a lot, have to compensate quite a lot

@5 - Boiling without lid and attached the out-hose from the cooler with a clip to the side of the boiler

The cooling flow through the plate cooler was really slow, the pump had to work hard to get just a steady flow. Maybe because of the low volume - showing 6-7l - Should have considered added more water to the boil fase

The punp wasn't able to pump the wort out!

Decided to add 4 l of clear water, from the tap, just to get the wort diluted and pumped out of the boiler - will be surprised if this brew gets any good ;)

So a lot of learning, will be interesting to see if this brew gets any good :)
