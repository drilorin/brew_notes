Notes:

First time with Brew in a Bag. Rehydrated the yeast to begin with, so it was ready for the transfer to the fermentation bucket.

This is also the first time with the STC 1000. The wort will ferment in the work shop, with a HeatWrap and automation to control the temperature. Since I am using SafeAle S-04 in this brew, I will try and hold it on 18 C with 0.5 C until the STC should react.

Decided to not use a pump and sparging, so a back to the roots sort of brew. Also, I am trying to find out how few things I need for each brew, so I don't have to walk back and forth to the kitchen a lot of times on brew day.

Cleaning after BIAB was SOO easy! 5-6 mins tops!

Tried the new hop spider, first off it's a great idea.
