Notes:
Decided to use the fake bottom inlay in the brew kettle since I am brewing a full 20 litre batch again. This was a "bad" decision, the effectiveness was really low and it was really hard to mash out, since the inlay was really compact from all the grist.  
This is the second fermaentation to use preassure fermentation and the first to try dry hopping  
Did a dryhopp addition in a bag, suspended with a magnet, to be released from the outside of the fermenter.
