Notes:

Yeast used: SafAle T-58 - peppery and spicy flavour

Should start with less water next time, perhaps 13-14 litres. Remember to withdraw 3 cms from the mash inlay top

Mashout, was almost not able to add mashout liquid

Before boiling fase, 10 cm from top ~ 17 litres - need to boil longer than 60 mins

Decided to make a measuring stick with litres, instead of measuring tape
