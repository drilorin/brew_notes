Notes:

Yeast used: SafAle T-58 - peppery and spicy flavour

Should start with less water next time, perhaps 13-14 litres. Remember to withdraw 3 cms from the mash inlay top

Mashout, was almost not able to add mashout liquid

Before boiling fase, 10 cm from top ~ 17 litres - need to boil longer than 60 mins

Decided to make a measuring stick with litres, instead of using measuring tape

Bottling:

Decided to bottle in one case (20 * 33cl) and the rest in larger bottles.

Found out that my 33 cl bottles needed more cleaning, so I was left with the options of 5 * Â½l, 6 * 1l and a mason jar with 75cl in it. All in all: 9,25l

Closing thoughts: Will monitor and bottle faster when the fermentation is done
