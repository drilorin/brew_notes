Notes:
  Tried this run with the raised sides from the mashing inlay, but without the bottom in it. In that way, the BIAB didn't touch the bottom which, I believe, gave the false temperature readings.
  Adjusted the length of the hopps bags, to be much longer than usual in order for the hopps to fully expand. I plan on squeeze them a bit when the boiling is complete.
  I squeezed the BIAB a great deal, after mashing, instead of doing a sparge cycle.
  Packaging the beer went quite well. I cleaned the keg with starsan and forced some starsan through the hose I would use for transferring the finished beer. Flushed the keg with CO2 and made ready.
  Then I fed beer through the beer out dip tupe, which has a little filter at the end. This resulted in a lot of gunk being stuck inside the filter, so that was bad. Next time I will fill it with the Co2 port instead.
