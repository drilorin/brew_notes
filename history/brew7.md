Notes:
```
Quite low After mash gravity reading but evened out.
The airlock went dry 3 times in the beginning of the fermentation. Refilled it and rocked the fermenter a bit each time.

```
```
20230205 - Decided to add 7.5 g sugar pr litre instead of 6.5 since the previous batches had been a bit underwhelming in terms of after carbonation
FG was a little higher than anticipated, it might be because of the airlock problems and I did no gravity readings. I will learn from that in the next batch
