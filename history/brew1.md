Notes:

First brew. Work flows were more or less planned and thought through, but there were still a few challenges.

There are many notes for the next brew and a lot of stuff has been aquired

20221011 - Because of a missing thermometer and bad cooling method, the wort must have been too warm when I added the yeast. The result is that the fermenting process is not starting. Since the wort is now smelling bitter, even sour, I decided to abandon this first brew.
