Notes:
  There is a problem with the temp while mashing, causing the kettle to continue heating. This resulted in the first 30 mins starting at 66c and ending at 72c. Then stoppede the timer / heater and mashed "manually". Will try with both the kettle insert and the BIAB next time.
  I went with hopping without bags this time. It made the finished volume a bit lower, since the free flowing hopps swallowed up a bit of water in the end.
