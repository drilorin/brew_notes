Notes:
  There is a problem with the temp while mashing, causing the kettle to continue heating. This resulted in the first 30 mins starting at 66c and ending at 72c. Then stoppede the timer / heater and mashed "manually". Will try with both the kettle insert and the BIAB next time.
  I went with hopping without bags this time. It made the finished volume a bit lower, since the free flowing hopps swallowed up a bit of water in the end.
  Finished fermenting 20230624 - Which is a fermentation time of about 2 weeks, which is suprising. Will do an FG when bottling
  Ended up not bottling it, it was in the middle of summer vacation, and the end result was quite bitter. The beer was served from the fermenter, with a Co2 bottle and the fermenter was then cleaned and made ready for next batch.
