Notes:

First time with 20+ litres brew. Started with 19 l mash and will add 6 l sparging water via the tap (hot water) since I use BIAB. After mashing, raising the temp to 78 C and then add the water while dripping from the bag.
The brew kettle kept warming in the last half of the mash, so the temp reached around 70 before I stopped it. This can greatly affect the taste afterwards.
Mashout was WAY harder than the half batches I have done so far. Will consider diverging from BIAB with larger batches.
13 cm from top after mashout ~ 15 l left
Added water to 3 cm from top ~ About 9 l
Will add more water next time - and use the inlay
