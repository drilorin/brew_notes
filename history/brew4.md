Notes:

Started with hot water from the tap, which was about 55C - made the startup time MUCH faster

Decided to try to ferment without an airlock, with just the lid loosely on

Next brew I will only sparge with 2 L of water since the OG is still only 1035 with 10 mins to go. Will have to boil longer, again.

Will try with a boil in a bag system next time so I can hit a better OG with the same amount of water.

20221116 - Fermenting stopped. Did i G reading of 1012 - which could be great, but it stopped fermenting far too fast. Will try the same brew again, but ferment with an airlock next time.
20221119 - Did a reading of 1010
20221123 - Did a reading of 1008
20221201 - Bottle day. Final reading 1008
