Notes:

After mashing and sparging, the volume was actually 16 litres. Will reduce the spargin volume to the next brew

Had to boil more than 60 mins to compensate for the boiling volume. 1Â½ hours more to be exact.

Rehydrated the yeast before adding it to the fermenter:
Boiled some water, waited until it was back down to 35 C. Poured 10 * the weight of the yeast (11.5g) in a jar. Poured the yeast in the water, waited 15 mins, swirled the jar, waited another 5 mins and made sure the yeast and the wort was no more than 10 c from each other.

The finished wort: 8,5 litres - still got a lot to learn about the volumes.

Used alcohol in the air lock - Like Alex does :)

Fermentation in the air lock stopped 20221114 - 10 days after brew day - will do a gravity reading tomorrow.
